## Description

Creating a database application using different tools and software such as SQL, inquirer, express, and consoletable. Application allows you to access database to view departments, roles, and employees on file, along with the addition of new implementations. 

I did use external resources such as geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, youtube, and MDN files.
